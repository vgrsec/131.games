                      <code>This is because the Arks of Omen tournament pack drops on Jan-14 and provides players with only 7 days to retool their armies.</code>

Our judge is an award winning painter from <strong><a href="https://boltersatdawn.com/" target="_blank">Bolters at Dawn</a></strong> the creators of <strong>Echoes from the Void</strong></p></li>
                      <li><strong>Crusade Points</strong> 
                        <p>Tournament Games do not need to be recorded in Administratum as these games do not count towards Planetary Control points</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Changing out units between games</strong>
                        <p>Players will be able to change out units between games after they learn the mission. There will be approximately 10 minutes between the end of each round to allow for administrative tasks required to swap units</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Time</strong>
                        <p>Each game will be given 2.5 hours to play, chess clocks or stopwatches are encouraged</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Scoring</strong>
                        <p>Each game will award points by way of primary and tertiary objectives. At the end of each game sum primary and tertiary objectives to get your final score. Winner is the highest total score.</p>
                      <li><strong>RP for new players</strong>
                        <p>If a player has never played an Echoes from the Void crusade game, they will start with 10 RP. Players are expected to spend this down below the Crusade rules maximum of 5 RP before their first game or excess RP will be lost.</p>
                      <li><strong>RP during games</strong>
                        <p>Players will not be allowed to use RP between games but may go over the normal 5RP in the bank. At the end of the tournament players are expected to spend back down to 5RP or below by their next game</p>
                      <li><strong>Faction mini-games</strong>
                        <p>All games count towards faction mini-games however all effects and accounting is to be done after the tournament. </p>
                      <li><strong>Experience and Out of Action</strong> 
                        <p>In the tunnels on Gnurn you learn fast or die fast. Units that have been doing all the fighting find themselves unchallenged by inexperienced units and are incapable of gaining experience from fighting. Units that are new to the fight find themselves able to gain experience faster.</p>
                        <p>The following table modifies normal Crusade rules for number of experience points and for out of action tests after each battle. For instance if a unit with 0 experience gets marked for greatness after a battle, it receives 6 experience rather than the normal 3. In the next battle their experience is no longer doubled.</p>
                        <p>Battle scars and experience rewards are immediately available after each game. Battlescars must be applied before the next game, experience may be spent between games</p>
                        <code>This is to allow new armies and players to get into the fight fast</code>

								<p>The air was artificial. Thuna 6MK's atmospheric emanators shook the surface support piercing the void of space over the collapsed hemisphere. It was a beautiful sight... in its own way. The moon's crafted surface gave way to the planet's cold metal core. A feint orange light suggested moon was breathing its last mechanical breath. In the flashing blackness of space above, small silhouettes of tendrils and wings flickered directionless yet with purpose.</p>

								<p>The tears in reality woven in the warp storm briefly parted to reveal a concerning secret of Huthar. The sky did not greet its visitors with a warm glow, but rather a distorted lens of colorless starlight. The system's star was now a black hole, surrounded by what was once star harvesters now sinking pitifully into it's horizon.</p>

								<p>What was unclear became hard truth; Huthar floated dead and cold through the void.</p>

								<p>The air no longer carried the thin bitterness of metal, but was forcefully replaced with a hollow stench and foul decay that would leave bare skin sweating with disgust.</p>

								<p>A trail of sloughed flesh followed the risen grandson who peered into the vastness of chaos above him. He took in this information, disappointed at the lack of opportunity. Was there no life left to gift his blessings?</p>

								<p>Laughter filled his senses. Amused laughter, yes, but unwelcome and unpleasant by nature. Glitched and irregular. Terror himself appeared shrouded in pale flesh, surrounded by phantoms of the night, angry with the failures of his ally. He cared not of the tides of this war, for his pleasure was found in murder.</p>

								<p>The blade of Mercy met an unforeseen yet welcome rival.</p>
								
								<p>High above the meaningless squander, this new information sparked a particular sense of enjoyment. Perhaps .75 seconds is necessary, especially among the others aboard, even the Warmaster, enjoying the intoxicating hedonism available. The journey had an end; a path paved; a final destination. The vaults of Gnurn hold the key.</p>

								<p>...</p>

								<p>The sanctum stood still. The teleportarium chamber was pitch black and sealed behind thick panes of glass and a small security door. Offline and frozen in time. </p>

								<p>Two lights in the room were all that gave what light existed on Marthammor: a phosphorescent blue pouring out from a lightless orb floating in the center, and a single monitor revealing the face of the watchman in the darkness.</p>

								<p>Countless cables, wiring, injectors, and various life support systems built the post in which he sat. An eternal task. Technically conscious, for one purpose. Monitor the Altar of Transcendence and ensure its stability until a suitable savior arrived. </p>

								<p>A servant. Martyr. Volunteer. Prisoner. Bonded to his duty. Waiting for what seemed to be the inevitable.</p>

								<p>His eyes shifted slightly to the new alert. "PROXIMITY SENSORS ACTIVATED: VAULT 634DE-45912." The emotionless response suggested this was not the first occurrence of this message. Centuries past have withered such feelings. The engineers made them far too sensitive. The wasteland of Gnurn threw too much debris to warrant any concern or care. Regardless, the video feed would provide him something other than the surge of scrolling status messages since the predicted death of the local star.</p>

								<p>The watchman issued a mental command to the system before his eyes, and a video feed flickered to life.</p>

								<p>Another pair of eyes met his gaze.</p>

								<p>Hope.</p>

								<p>A chill crept down his motionless spine. An unmistakable horror, and an incomprehensible figure words failed to describe.</p>

								<p>Despair.</p>

								<p>Ancient instincts were found deep within his mind, lost for ages but not forgotten. </p>

								<p>Another command issued. Another alert raised.</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Again...</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Please...</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Hopelessness, trapped in the course of imminent inevitability.</p>
