								<p>The air was artificial. Thuna 6MK's atmospheric emanators shook the surface support piercing the void of space over the collapsed hemisphere. It was a beautiful sight... in its own way. The moon's crafted surface gave way to the planet's cold metal core. A feint orange light suggested moon was breathing its last mechanical breath. In the flashing blackness of space above, small silhouettes of tendrils and wings flickered directionless yet with purpose.</p>

								<p>The tears in reality woven in the warp storm briefly parted to reveal a concerning secret of Huthar. The sky did not greet its visitors with a warm glow, but rather a distorted lens of colorless starlight. The system's star was now a black hole, surrounded by what was once star harvesters now sinking pitifully into it's horizon.</p>

								<p>What was unclear became hard truth; Huthar floated dead and cold through the void.</p>

								<p>The air no longer carried the thin bitterness of metal, but was forcefully replaced with a hollow stench and foul decay that would leave bare skin sweating with disgust.</p>

								<p>A trail of sloughed flesh followed the risen grandson who peered into the vastness of chaos above him. He took in this information, disappointed at the lack of opportunity. Was there no life left to gift his blessings?</p>

								<p>Laughter filled his senses. Amused laughter, yes, but unwelcome and unpleasant by nature. Glitched and irregular. Terror himself appeared shrouded in pale flesh, surrounded by phantoms of the night, angry with the failures of his ally. He cared not of the tides of this war, for his pleasure was found in murder.</p>

								<p>The blade of Mercy met an unforeseen yet welcome rival.</p>
								
								<p>High above the meaningless squander, this new information sparked a particular sense of enjoyment. Perhaps .75 seconds is necessary, especially among the others aboard, even the Warmaster, enjoying the intoxicating hedonism available. The journey had an end; a path paved; a final destination. The vaults of Gnurn hold the key.</p>

								<p>...</p>

								<p>The sanctum stood still. The teleportarium chamber was pitch black and sealed behind thick panes of glass and a small security door. Offline and frozen in time. </p>

								<p>Two lights in the room were all that gave what light existed on Marthammor: a phosphorescent blue pouring out from a lightless orb floating in the center, and a single monitor revealing the face of the watchman in the darkness.</p>

								<p>Countless cables, wiring, injectors, and various life support systems built the post in which he sat. An eternal task. Technically conscious, for one purpose. Monitor the Altar of Transcendence and ensure its stability until a suitable savior arrived. </p>

								<p>A servant. Martyr. Volunteer. Prisoner. Bonded to his duty. Waiting for what seemed to be the inevitable.</p>

								<p>His eyes shifted slightly to the new alert. "PROXIMITY SENSORS ACTIVATED: VAULT 634DE-45912." The emotionless response suggested this was not the first occurrence of this message. Centuries past have withered such feelings. The engineers made them far too sensitive. The wasteland of Gnurn threw too much debris to warrant any concern or care. Regardless, the video feed would provide him something other than the surge of scrolling status messages since the predicted death of the local star.</p>

								<p>The watchman issued a mental command to the system before his eyes, and a video feed flickered to life.</p>

								<p>Another pair of eyes met his gaze.</p>

								<p>Hope.</p>

								<p>A chill crept down his motionless spine. An unmistakable horror, and an incomprehensible figure words failed to describe.</p>

								<p>Despair.</p>

								<p>Ancient instincts were found deep within his mind, lost for ages but not forgotten. </p>

								<p>Another command issued. Another alert raised.</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Again...</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Please...</p>

								<p style="font-family: 'vt323'; font-size: 18px;color: #acff9d;">"GNURN SYSTEMS UNRESPONSIVE..."</p>

								<p>Hopelessness, trapped in the course of imminent inevitability.</p>

                <p>The players now set objective markers up on the battlefield. Each mission’s deployment map will show the players how many to set up, and where each should be placed.</p>
                <p>
                On your <a href="./Echoes_from_the_Void_Tracker_-_Score_Sheet_v2.pdf" target="_blank">crusade scoring sheet</a> write down the primary objective(s).<br/>
                </p>
                <hr style="border: 1px dashed black; background-color: #EAEFF5" />
                <h5>Agendas</h5>
                <p>
                  Each player then secretly selects Agendas for the battle and writes them down. Each can award experience points to certain units in that player's army, as described on the Agenda itself. Once both players have selected their Agendas, they reveal their selections to their opponent.

                <h5>Tertiary Objectives</h5>
                <p>
                  This chapter includes a Tertiary Objective.
                </p>
                <h6>SETUP</h6>
                <p>Place 4 tunnel entrances around the battlefield on the Terrain Piece 3 in determine mission terrain placement.</p>

                <h6>VAULT SEARCH</h6>

                <p>Players can control the vault entrance as long as they are within 3" of the vault model. The player who controls the vault will be determined in the same way that control of an objective is determined, with the exception of the vault model being considered the objective marker. </p>

                <h6>ENTER VAULT TUNNELS (ACTION):</h6>
                <p>Up to two INFANTRY unit from your army can embark into the tunnels if it is within 3" of each vault entrance during your movement phase. Remove this unit from the battlefield. They are now located in the vault tunnels, and can search the various vaults for key code intel. Only two of each players units are allowed to be embarked in the tunnel at any time.</p>

                <p>For each friendly unit in the tunnel system in your movement phase, roll a D6. On a roll of 5+, that unit discovers a Teleportarium Key Code. Each time a friendly unit attempts this search, reduce the required roll to a minimum of 2+.</p>
                
                <p>If an enemy unit is currently embarked in the tunnels: on an unmodified roll of 1, when searching for Teleportarium Key Codes, a tunnel fight occurs. The unit that rolled to search for the Teleportarium Key Code and one random enemy unit will be deployed onto the tunnel fight side board. Each unit will be deployed within 3" of the short side of the tunnel fight side board and on the same side of the table as that players table edge. For the remainder of the round the side board follows the phases and procedures as the main play area but contained inside the tunnel fight side board.</p>

                <p><strong>Sideboard</strong>The sideboard size is 11x17. Off the Wall Games has side board cards to help</p>

                <p>If no enemy units are left in the tunnel fight at the beginning of the movement phase you may remove all of your units in the tunnel fight and continue to search for Teleportarium Key Codes or exit the tunnels as normal.</p>

                <p>If a tunnel fight is currently on going and another 1 is rolled when attempting to discover a Teleporatrium Key Code, and there is currently an enemy unit in the tunnel fight, then that unit is deployed to the tunnel fight as prescribed above but no enemy unit is added to the tunnel fight.</p>
                
                <p>If the unit involved in the tunnel fight had moved any other time this turn with the exception of embarking in the tunnels it may not move any further in the tunnel fight side board.</p>

                <p>Units that are currently tunnel fighting cannot attempt to discover a Teleportarium Key Code.</p>

                <p>If it is not the first turn of the tunnel fight for a unit you control, in the movement phase, the player who's turn it is may choose to have that unit retreat from the tunnel fight by exiting the tunnels through a valid tunnel entrance and suffers D3 mortal wounds. Follow EXIT VAULT TUNNELS below.</p>

                <h6>EXIT VAULT TUNNELS:</h6>
                <p>At the start of your movement phase, any units currently in the tunnel system may exit from any uncontrolled or friendly-controlled tunnel entrance. Follow disembark rules when a unit is redeployed to a tunnel exit. If the unit is unable to exit the vault tunnels, they may do so next turn. If any unit is inside the tunnel system at the end of the game, consider this unit destroyed.</p>

                <h6>DESTROY TUNNEL ENTRANCE (ACTION):</h6>
                <p>One INFANTRY unit from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement Phase if it is within 3" of a vault entrance. The unit places a timed explosive on the tunnel entrance. If this unit is still on the battlefield at the start of your next command phase, the tunnel entrance is destroyed, and cannot be controlled, entered, or exited from for the rest of the game. Remove the tunnel entrance from the battlefield.</p>

                <p>The player who discovers the most Teleportrium Key Codes wins the tertiary for the game.</p>

                <p><i><b>NOTE: Track the number of key codes each player discovers. This will impact your ability to complete the tertiary objective in a future chapter.</b></i></p>

                Terrain location and placement is optional, except for terrain piece 3, this is required this chapter. <br/>Two players may chose any terrain setup. If agreed upon by both players,   one player can set up terrain before the battle</p>
                
                <p>Identify the terrain setup for the mission in the table in DETERMINE MISSION</p>

                <p>Roll 1d6 to determine who places the first piece of terrain. Take in turn placing terrain. Place each terrain types until all pieces of that type have been placed in the following order:<br/>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Terrain Piece 1 - Large Ruins</li>
                    <li>Terrain Piece 2 - Mid Sized Ruins</li>
                    <li>Terrain Piece 3 - Tertiary Objective</li>

                <h4>6. Choose Deployment Zone </h4>
                <p>
                  The deployment maps for some missions will tell you which deployment zone is the Attacker’s and which is the Defender’s. If the deployment map does not show this, but instead labels deployment zones as Player A’s or Player B’s, then the Defender now selects one of the deployment zones for their army. Their opponent uses the other deployment zone.
                </p>       

                <hr />

                <p>
                  Players alternate resolving any pre-battle abilities units in their army may have, and resolving any Stratagems that are used before the battle, starting with the player who will take the first turn. Remember that Crusade forces can only make use of Stratagems that upgrade units by using Requisition points.
                </p>
