								<p>Have you felt what it is like to lose your feet? To fall into nothing, awaiting the crash? Trapped in a promised path?</p>

								<p>Your friends stayed behind to grant you this passage, as you greet their gaze one last time. Perhaps the bravest among you. You become enveloped with darkness as you venture into Marthammor.</p>

								<p>Immediately, you are overwhelmed with uncomfortable sensation. Your arms feel detached, yet strangled with forces unseen. Stretched, squeezed, and bent in time, falling through flashes of light and dark.</p>

								<p>Blood and armor and time cloud what can be seen. Claws of beasts rip into flesh and chainswords cleave as the flickering images of brutal war echo around you. Soundless screams of the dying, their faces marked with helpless horror. The battle is not won, but it is not lost. Not yet.</p>

								<p>You are in the void. Pure blackness fades to view. Streaks of blue light suggest others have made it this far, tumbling through space and time. Ahead, a faint white light, like a distant star, welcomes the invaders of Huthar.</p>

								<p>Static broken communication fills your mind as your comrades reach out for contact, but that technology does not work in this place.</p>

								<p>Images invade your mind from a source unseen. Images of a peaceful colony, sowing the fields of Selleon. The fires of industry burn on Thuna. A successful race, it appears. Shorter and stockier than what the Imperium of man might consider standard for their enlisted. And then, to the tunnels of Gnurn. For a deep secret was unveiled. In the depths of the ore fields beneath the surface of Gnurn, a secret no man could survive. Pure unstable chaos infused the core, attempting to breach its prison. Those unlucky enough to be the First Eyes were seared from reality. Almost instantly, Huthar responded. Not the Votann that held residence here, but the interlinked systems they crafted. Marthammor, the AI construct, initiated containment protocols, and at once, the dyson drones sped towards Gnurn. Marthammor's core chamber shifted and fed reserved material to construct a safe haven; a shield world. All across Huthar, automated transport pods sprung to life, and alarms sounded. As if their entire civilization were drilled in practice, they were delivered to Marthammor with haste.</p>

								<p>The dyson drones arrived at Gnurn and weaved through the cavernous ore fields and began constructing a containment structure within the planet itself, around its core. The Votann architects knew their craft well. These systems worked tirelessly in mere days to complete the isolation. A success, but a failure as well, for chaos found its way through the cracks to freedom. It took nearly all of the dyson drones in the system to seal the final surface, sacrificing themselves for their creators. But the warp energies manifested, intercepting some of the late transports delivering the colony to Marthammor. Those who survived stepped beneath the Altar, and were sent onwards to their artificial haven, awaiting salvation, while the warp energies began to multiply and infect the system into an unstable and eternal storm.</p>

								<p>The distant light in the void drew closer. Just as it consumes you, your eyes meet the end of the road.</p>

								<p>A dark chamber rests before you, housing a large spherical altar made of metal and light. The watchman sits with wide eyes as your friends and your enemies arrive steadily throughout the chamber. A swift shadow growls and crosses your vision and feasts on the helpless man sitting alone at his terminal.</p>

								<p>Mechanical sounds echo through the room in response, and all light fades, all except for the Altar of Transcendence; now offering the only thing that can be seen. Strange visions appear warped and distorted around its core sphere. Faces. Peering across their plane of existence into the room, frozen with fear. Some faces are familiar. Faces of the colony. The shield world, and its entrance, stands before you. </p>

								<p>Three towers pulse a bright blue in reaction, and form an unnatural connection to their parent construct, the Altar of Transcendence. A deafening shockwave bending light and time emanates from the large orb in the center of the room, enveloping the new arrivals.</p>

								<p>Many of those who stand beside you, and some of those who stand against you, fade violently from existence. They are no more.</p>

								<p>Those remaining draw their weapons and prepare for what may be their last fight, in a lost and forgotten corner of the universe.</p>

								<p>Will you save the colony? Will you leave them imprisoned and consume their world? Will you terminate the Altar and unwrite the Votann from existence? Will you enter the shield world and attempt a diplomatic shared life among the warp torn system of Huthar?</p>

								<p>May the last one standing decide.</p>

          <h3>MISSION BRIEFING</h3>
            <!--
			<p>Visions of the past, delivered through unknown means, filled your senses as you fell through the void into Marthammor's core chamber. With the arrival of all factions, and the swift death of the Watchman, Marthammor's core chambers attempted an automated defense activation that left your forces dwindled. Only the best of you survived, and will take on the final battle.</p>
			
			<p>Your faction will fight to the last remaining man, with the survivors deciding the fate of the entire system's colony of Votann survivors decimated from the chaos warp discovered in the depths of Gnurn. Controlling the automated defense systems intertwined with the mysterious technology within the Altar of Transcendence will grant your allies the ability to manipulate time and space to your benefit.</p>

				<h5> <a href="./chapter5-setup.html" target="_blank">CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS</a></h5>


          	<h3>MISSION RULES</h3>

				<p><b>BALANCE THE SCALES:</b>
				Before the start of the game determine the total experience of each players <i>Order of Battle</i>. The player with the highest amount of experience starts the battle with 0 CP. The player with the second highest starts with 50% of their normal CP (round up). The lowest player starts with their normal amount of CP.<br/>

				The team who won +1 CP from Planetary Control receives +2 Command Points at the beginning of every turn.</p>
				
				<p><b>ARRIVAL IN THE SANCTUM:</b> Each player brings a 500 battle-forged army. Players list are defined by Warzone Nephilim OR Arks of Omen. This means detachments can be Arks of Omen Detachment, or any other previously legal detachment from this crusade. This army must be built from a players order of battle. Each player should roll a single D6, using any bonuses from Attacker/Defender received throughout the campaign. The winning dice roll chooses one of three deployment zones located on the circular battlefield. The second highest chooses from the remaining two deployment zones. The last faction receives the remaining deployment zone.</p>

				<p><b>CONTINUED ARRIVAL:</b> Starting round 2, each player may deploy 125 points worth of units from their order of battle wholly within 3" of the teleporter as strategic reserves. Any points not spent in a players return are retained until spent. </p>
				<p>
				Each time a unit from your army arrives from Strategic Reserves, you can choose to set it up anywhere that is wholly within 3" of the teleporter in your deployment zone. If you do so can be set up within Engagement Range of enemy models. If a unit is set up within Engagement Range of any enemy models in this way, it counts as having made a charge move this turn (Overwatch attacks cannot be made against that unit), and until the end of the turn, that unit can target any enemy unit it is within Engagement Range of with melee attacks, even though it did not declare a charge this turn. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				If a unit arrives and is unable to deploy within 3" due to enemy models and or friendly models, models must be removed from within 3" of the teleporter until the unit arriving is able to deploy. If only enemy models are blocking teleporting into battle, the player that controls those models chooses which to remove to make a space large enough to allow for teleportation. If multiple players are blocking the teleporter roll 1d2 or 1d3 (depending on number of players blocking) and assign numbers to players, the number rolled is which player removes models to allow deployment. If deployment space is not achieved continue rolling for player removing models, and remove models until enough space has been created. 
				</p>

				
				<p><b>DISRUPTED SPACETIME:</b> (Aura) The reality around the Altar of Transcendence is warped and chaotic, pulsing irregularly throughout the battle 10" away. By interacting with the Transcendental Door in various ways, the Altar of Transcendence will discharge warp energies onto the battlefield.</p>

				<p><b>ECHO CHARGING:</b> All doors at the beginning of the battle have zero Echo Charge Counters. There are three ways a door can be Charged to activate DISRUPTED SPACETIME. Charges last until discharged. Doors cannot be destroyed. Doors stats are Strength 8, Toughness 9, 7+ Save, Leadership 20, and have the Fortification keyword. You may charge a door in the charge phase, but the model only considered to be engaged for the purposes of rolling fight phase attacks. No other rules apply for being engaged in combat.
				</p>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Receives 6 Mortal Wounds from Psychic Abilities in a single psychic phase: +1 Echo Charge (once per turn). </li>
						<li>Receives 10 damage in a single shooting phase: +1 Echo Charge (once per turn).</li>
						<li>Receives 10 damage in a single fight phase: +1 Echo Charge (once per turn).</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>Echo Charges carry over between turns, but are removed when the DISCHARGE DOOR action is completed. Doors are considered enemy units for the purpose of abilities that affect the closest enemy model. Each door has a separate count of Echo Charges.</p>

				<p><b>DISCHARGE DOOR (Action):</b> Select from the following two variations of this action to perform:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>(Action) The Void Defends:</b> At the end of your movement phase, a unit can start to perform this action if within 3" of any door. This action completes at the end of your turn. Remove all charges from the door. Deal 1 mortal wound for each Echo Charge removed to all enemy units affected by DISRUPTED SPACETIME.
						</li>
						<li><b>(Action) The Void Returns:</b> At the end of your movement phase, a unit can start to perform this action if within 3" of any door. This action completes at the end of your turn. Remove all charges from the door. One model in each friendly unit from your army affected by DISRUPTED SPACETIME can regain up to XD3 lost wounds, where X is the number of Echo Charges removed from the door. If every model in that unit has a Wounds characteristic of 1, that unit can instead be replenished. When a unit is replenished, you can return XD3 destroyed models to that unit with their full wounds remaining, where X is the number of Echo Charges removed from the door. Each returned model no longer counts as having been destroyed for the purposes of Morale tests this turn.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				 <p><b>Vox Shroud:</b> Units must deploy wholly within their deployment zones, even if they have an ability that allows them to set up elsewhere. If a unit can move after deployment but before the first turn begins, it must end that move wholly within your deployment zone. Any time a unit is set up on the battlefield, either because it is arriving from Strategic Reserves or Reinforcements or it has been affected by a rule that instructs you to remove the unit and set it back up on the battlefield, it must be set up wholly within your own deployment zone.</p>

				 <p><b>Terrain Piece 1</b>These large Ruins terrain pieces all fall into the Area Terrain category and have the Scalable, Breachable, Light Cover, Defensible, and Obscuring traits. </p>
