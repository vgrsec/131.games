              <p>Echoes from the Void consists of five chapters.</p>
              <p>Each chapter is played using a "Cycle", or a group of games to be completed before the next cycle or chapter can start. Cycles require every player to compete in the assigned number of games. Each game must be submitted to the League Leader before the next Cycle can start. The structure of each Chapter and Cycle is detailed below.</p>

              <h4>Supply</h4>
              <p>Players will start each chapter with enough supply to field an army at the point limit of the chapter. A player can choose to increase their supply limit for their roster with RP, but can never field more points than the chapter limit.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Points vs Power Level</h4>
              <p>Echoes from the Void uses points instead of power level (pl). All pl calculations in narrative rules be converted as 1PL = 20 points</p>
            </div>

            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Requisition Points</h4>
              <p>There is a maximum limit of 5 RP that can be held at any given time. This must be spent before you can gain any more RP. This value is configurable in Administratum by the League Leader</p>
            </div>

              <h4>Administratum</h4>
              <p>Administratum invite code is: <strong>PT6ZNTY</strong></p>
              <p>All Crusade Forces should be tracked and maintained in Administratum for the duration of the league.</p>

            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Score Sheet</h4>
              <p>Each player should have access to a Crusade Match scoresheet. This can be downloaded <a href="Echoes_from_the_Void_Tracker_-_Score_Sheet_v2.pdf">Here</a>. All scoresheets should be turned into the League Leader at the end of each battle. The League Leader should note players involved, the mission, winner, and tertiary victor.</p>

              <h4>Proxy Models</h4>
              <p>Players are able to field proxy models in their army presuming the following conditions are met.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The proxy model is clearly different from other models in the army. <br/><i>For example, in a Space Marine army with a squad of 10 Marines with bolters, it is not ok to declare one of those bolter models to have a plasma pistol. This is because it will not be easy for your opponent to identify the weapons and capabilities of that unit.</i></li>
                <li>The proxy model is the same size, and on the same base, as the model you intend to proxy. <br/><i>For example, in a Space Marine army it is not OK to use a Rhino as a Land Raider because they are different sizes. It is also not ok to use Tactical Marines as Primaris Marines as they are different sizes and use different bases (32mm vs 40mm). </i></li>
                <li>The proxy model is close to quality to the model you intend to proxy <br/><i>For example 3d printed models with noticeable print lines, or a scratch build model that's identifiable as its original object are both examples of proxy models that should be avoided.</i></li>

              <h4>planetary control/Scoring Points</h4>
              <p>Each chapter offers a permanent reward to all members of the faction who scores the most Planetary Control (PC) points. These PC points can be gained through the following ways:</p>

    		  <ul>
    		  	<li>Crusade Victories</li>
    			<li>Tertiary Objectives</li>
    			<li>Hobby Goals</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>When a match is complete, the victor wins 1 PC point towards their Crusade Victories.</p>

			  <p>In each match, a chapter-specific Tertiary Objective will be up for grabs. Each time a player wins the Tertiary Objective, the victor wins 1 PC point for their faction.</p>

			  <p>Each chapter includes a hobby goal. Each player earns 1 PC for their faction if at the end of the chapter they have the number of points for the chapter painted in their roster to a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2019/05/21/introducing-battle-readygw-homepage-post-1fw-homepage-post-1/" target="_blank">battle ready standard</a> , as defined by Games Workshop.

              <p>Each player is expected to play the number of games prescribed in the chapter table per chapter. By playing this number of games, players will achieve the maximum number of Planetary Control points, experience for units, and battle scars available to them.</p>
              <p>Should a player wish to play greater or fewer games please review exhibition and substitution rules</p>
              <p>Special Ops games are available to those who have completed the number of prescribed games of the chapter. Those who have not completed their prescribed games are not able to participate in special ops</p>

              <h4>Exhibition Matches</h4>
              <p>Each player may only be credited a maximum of the number of games described per chapter. Should a player play more games (either for fun, or assisting another player with completing their games due to schedule conflicts), the exhibition player may not score tertiaries, gain experience for their units, take battle scars, or record their match as a win. For all intents and purposes, the exhibition player should have no history of the match being played. However the player who needs additional games, playing an exhibition player is able to score tertiaries, planetary control points, experience, and battle scars as normal</p>

              <h4>Substitution</h4>
              <p>Each player who has not played their maximum number of games as described by the chapter may request a member of their faction to play a game for them. Players who play a substitution game may earn planetary control points and tertiaries points, but may not gain experience or battle scars for their units. </p>

This includes their own faction. A players kill team must be of the same faction as their crusade army. Players are only able to participate in a single special operation per chapter.

              <ul>
                <li>The legend model is listed on the GW legends page. <br/><i>For example, while Squats had rules at one point, and will have rules again in 9th. Until the rules in 9th are published, they are unplayable.</i></li>
